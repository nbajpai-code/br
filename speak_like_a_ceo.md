If you want to master communications as a leader in 2026, books are a great place to start. And the holidays are the perfect time to kick back with a great book.

Out of the 100+ books I read in 2025, here are my top ten picks for you:

## 1. My Book of the Year: Primal Intelligence
> Story is not a way to communicate but a form of intelligence, says Angus Fletcher, professor of story science at Ohio State University.

Stories didn’t evolve around the campfire thousands of years ago. Story is much, much older. In fact, the two functions of intelligence – logic and story – evolved over half a billion years and can be found not just in humans, but many animals.

While logic computes what is probable, story creates what is possible.

## 2. Top Pick Conversations: TALK
Ever wonder what makes a conversation truly meaningful? In *Talk: The Science of Conversation and the Art of Being Ourselves*, Harvard prof **Alison Wood Brooks** dives deep into the psychology and dynamics of effective communication.

Conversations are an art, but also a science. Instead of sticking with typical small talk like “What do you do?” you might ask, **“What’s been the most interesting part of your work lately?”**

This question not only sparks a deeper conversation but also taps into the cognitive process of curiosity and emotional connection.

## 3. Top Pick Writing: How to Write for Busy Readers
Ever written to a busy person without hearing back? You are not alone.

Professionals delete half of all emails without reading them. Harvard Prof **Todd Rogers** shows us how to communicate effectively in the real world where most messages go unanswered because the readers did not think it was worth their time.

**Key insights:** Everyone skims. Write for skimmers, not readers.

And: Busy readers have a very low threshold for moving on. Don’t give them any reason for an early exit.

## 4. Top Pick Storytelling: A Story is a Deal
**Will Storr’s** books *The Science of Storytelling* and *The Status Game* have had a profound impact on my thinking. This year he’s done it again with *A Story is a Deal*.

The book is not a simple A-B-C recipe for telling better stories to close a deal (although it does provide an excellent framework for better storytelling).

Rather Storr argues that we're not just wired for story. We are story-beings that connect with others and turn reality into a shared narrative.

It is what we do: We spend our lives seeking people-like-us who share our inner story-world.

> “For the storytelling brain, what feels true is true.”

## 5. Top Pick Leadership: Inspire
**Are You an Inspirational Leader – or an Infuriating One?** What separates leaders who uplift and energize from those who frustrate and demoralize?

In *Inspire: The Universal Path for Leading Yourself and Others*, Columbia Business School professor **Adam Galinsky** reveals the razor-thin line between leadership that sparks motivation and leadership that backfires.

Galinsky argues that leadership exists on a continuum from “inspirational” to “infuriating”, and even the best intentions can turn into micromanagement, disconnection, or unrealistic expectations.

To help leaders navigate these challenges, he introduces three dimensions of inspiring leadership: **The Visionary, The Exemplar, and The Mentor.** Which one are you?

## 6. Top Pick Executive Presence: Unforgettable Presence
**Lorraine K. Lee’s** career grew exponentially and unexpectedly in 2021 when she decided to get more comfortable with public speaking.

Full of nerves, she spoke whenever and wherever. In a surprising turn of events, speaking became a small side hustle while working in a startup. Then she got laid off in 2022 and decided to become the CEO of her own career. Today, she is a speaker, bestselling author and business influencer.

In *Unforgettable Presence*, she doesn’t just teach you how to speak and write better – she shows you how to replace the fluff with clarity, confidence, and kindness.

## 7. Top Pick Pitching: Pitch
What I love about **Danny Fontaine's** brand new book is that it is so universally applicable.

It's not just for high rolling deals or B2B sales. What he offers are universal principles and an all-purpose framework for pitching.

To be clear, there is no repeatable, infallible formula to create a perfect pitch. That’s because we are dealing with humans and their thoughts and emotions.

But there are identifiable and repeatable techniques that increase our chances of success. **Most importantly: A PowerPoint deck is not a pitch. Slides come last, not first.**

## 8. Top Pick Public Speaking: Speak, Memorably
> The more you blend in, the less you stand out.

In his new book, communications expert **Bill McGowan** identifies a crucial challenge for leaders everywhere: what once worked in communication no longer cuts through today. Yesterday’s formulas now lead to dead ends.

**Here are my three takeaways:**

1.  **Success no longer depends on staying “on message” but on winning – and keeping – attention.** I 100% agree: Scripted speakers and jargon jerks belong to the industrial age.
2.  **Your energy is infectious**, and McGowan’s definition of energy is spot on: “your visible enthusiasm for the information you share.”
3.  **Don’t repeat clichés – twist them.** That’s how you stay familiar yet fresh. Think “survival of the quickest” or, from my TEDx talk, “the gorilla in the boardroom.”

## 9. Top Pick for Female Leaders: Powerfully Likeable
**Kate Mason** explodes the myth at the heart of many women’s communication struggles: that you must choose between being likable and being powerful. It’s a false choice – and a dangerous one.

Mason, a communication coach and former world-champion debater, names the double bind that traps so many women:

> Speak up and risk being seen as “too much,” or stay agreeable and be overlooked.

But she offers a radical reframe – the problem isn’t you, it’s the outdated rules of the game.

**The solution?** Stop modifying yourself to fit someone else’s standard of “likable.” Instead, redefine power in your own terms and align your communication style with who you are.

The book is packed with practical strategies for communicating while female: how to say no without guilt, how to take up space without apology, and how to stop obsessing over how you’re perceived.

## 10. Top Pick Team Communication
I’ve been a huge fan of **Jon Levy’s** work ever since his bestselling book *You’re Invited* came out. With his new book *Team Intelligence*, Jon Levy doubles down on his lifelong fascination with human connection.

Studying extraordinary leaders, Jon noticed how different they all were, yet they shared one critical trait: the ability to spark magic between their people.

This led him to the key insight of his book: **success isn’t about gathering the smartest people in the room – it’s about creating a room where people can be their smartest together.**
